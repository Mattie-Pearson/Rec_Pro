# Rec_Pro
Recommendation Program

### Did you make sure there's a venv?
A venv python interpreter needs to be set up if one isn't alreadygit

### Running the program
Open a new terminal
Type <& C:\Workplace\Rec_Pro-main\.venv\Scripts\python.exe c:/Workplace/Rec_Pro-main/script.py> in the terminal. Paths may vary, but the python.exe and script.py need to be run in order for the program to work.

 -Note: The program doesn't take any arrow keys and won't open a new application window or anything fancy. You'll be using it directly within the terminal and need to make sure you're focused on it... There have been a few times where I've accidentally typed a num or letter just in my .py file cause I wasn't focused on the terminal.

## Quit the program
You can end the program at any time using <Ctrl + C>
