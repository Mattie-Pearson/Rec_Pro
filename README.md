### Running the program
Open a new terminal
type <python script.py>

 -Note: The program doesn't take any arrow keys and won't open a new application window or anything fancy. You'll be using it directly within the terminal and need to make sure you're focused on it... There have been a few times where I've accidentally typed a num or letter just in my .py file cause I wasn't focused on the terminal.

### What you can do in the program

## Quit the program
You can end the program at any time using <Ctrl + C>
